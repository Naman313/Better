How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-login-signup-app.git
2. **cd './Frontend'**
3. **npm i**
4. **npm run dev**

For design i have trie to keep it as simple as it could be on hovering over login aur signup box it shows shadows showcasing interactive behaviour
I have also added media queries to make it responsive.
